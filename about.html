            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>STEMInclusive IITK Chapter is a platform dedicated to celebrating the incredible achievements and stories
                of
                women of IIT Kanpur in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). We believe in the power
                of
                representation, storytelling, and community to inspire the next generation of women in India to pursue
                their dreams in STEM fields.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is simple yet profound: to shatter stereotypes, break down barriers, and pave the way for
                women to thrive in STEM. We are committed to creating a world where every young girl in India knows that
                her potential is limitless, regardless of her gender.</p>

            <h2>Why STEMInclusive?</h2>
            <p>In India, as in many parts of the world, women have been historically underrepresented in STEM. We
                believe that this gender gap not only deprives our society of diverse perspectives and innovation but
                also limits the potential of countless talented individuals. STEMInclusive aims to change this by:</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Spotlighting Remarkable Women:</strong> We showcase the stories of extraordinary women who
                    have excelled in various STEM fields. Through interviews, articles, and profiles, we bring their
                    journeys, challenges, and achievements to the forefront.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Providing Role Models:</strong> We firmly believe that you cannot be what you cannot see. By
                    featuring accomplished women in STEM, we provide role models for young girls to look up to,
                    demonstrating that they too can excel in these fields.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Building a Supportive Community:</strong> STEMInclusive is not just a website; it's a
                    community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for equality and inclusion in STEM. We
                    encourage networking, mentorship, and collaboration among women in STEM and those aspiring to join
                    the field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Encouraging STEM Education:</strong> We actively conduct STEM education initiatives and
                    workshops to ensure that every girl with an interest in STEM has the resources and
                    opportunities to succeed.

<h2 class="section-heading">Childhood Days</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sruti-s-ragavan/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Dr. Sruti S Ragavan</a>,
    is an assistant professor of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at IIT Kanpur. She grew up in
    Chennai with
    her
    cousins. She loved reading, finishing at least one book a week, mostly classical fiction. What made her proud was
    reading books her cousins hadn't read.</p>

<p>She was very interested in probability and statistics. Her interest came from her dad, who worked in insurance and
    had
    to make decisions based on those concepts. She tried to get into Chennai Mathematical Institute and Indian
    Statistical
    Institute which are the best institutes for mathematics in India but couldn't get in because they preferred Olympiad
    medallists. However, her math teacher suggested studying computer science instead as it is closely related to
    mathematics.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">College and Career</h2>
<p>After graduating with a degree in Comupter Science, Dr. Sruti S Ragavan joined Thoughtworks, attracted by its
    renowned work culture.
    Initially
    fascinated by the software made by JetBrains in her work, she aspired to work for JetBrains, but they exclusively
    hired PhD
    students
    with a systems and compilers background. Motivated by this, she decided to pursue a PhD in the field. However,
    during
    her doctoral studies, she took a Human Computer Interation (HCI) course and found her passion in the subject,
    leading her to switch her focus
    to
    HCI.</p>

<p>During her PhD journey, Dr. Sruti interned at Microsoft Research and eventually became a part of the diverse team,
    collaborating with prominent figures in the programming world, including one of the authors of the Haskell
    Programming
    language. The team also included researchers from various fields like Sociology and Ethnology. The team's culture
    encouraged experimentation, embracing failure as a valuable learning opportunity;
    approximately 50% of the ideas they explored did not succeed.</p>

<p>Her work extended to studying LLMs (the technology that powers ChatGPT) well before ChatGPT's emergence, focusing on
    understanding their ability to express concepts and analyzing human interactions with them. One significant project
    she contributed to, which even reached production, was the development of a Debugger for Microsoft Excel. Convincing
    individuals from various backgrounds to join this project, the debugger proved to be a game-changer, aiding
    non-coders in writing accurate formulas in Microsoft Excel. This project also earned recognition, receiving the 2nd
    best paper award at a reputable conference.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Advice for future students</h2>

<p>Firstly, she encourages having fun and not taking things too seriously. Embracing the learning process, making
    mistakes,
    and deriving lessons from them is a crucial aspect of personal and professional growth.</p>

<p>In particular, she highlights the misconception in India that STEM fields lack creativity and that people from
    traditionally considered "Arts" background have little space in STEM. Drawing from her diverse
    team and experiences at the Microsoft Research, she emphasizes that there is room for individuals from varied
    backgrounds in STEM,
    urging people to be inclusive and recognize the value each person brings.</p>

<p>Recognizing the need for improved social skills, Dr. Sruti emphasizes that these skills are not just "soft skills"
    but
    essential "life skills." She stresses the importance of developing interpersonal skills, as engineers often struggle
    in
    this area. Understanding that social skills are integral to navigating the dynamic world we live in, she challenges
    the
    misleading distinction between "soft" and "hard" skills.</p>

<p>Finally, Dr. Sruti advocates for pursuing higher education, countering the prevailing discouragement towards it in
    India.
    By
    emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and advanced education, she encourages individuals to invest in
    their
    intellectual and professional development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">A note of Gratitude</h2>

<p>Firstly, she acknowledges her cousin Shyam, her enduring role model since childhood. His influence has shaped her
    journey and contributed to her growth.</p>

<p>Her parents come next, for their unwavering support throughout her life and their encouragement of her pursuit of
    higher
    education. Their backing has been a constant source of strength.</p>

<p>Rajesh Babu, her manager at Thoughtworks, receives heartfelt appreciation. She considers him one of the smartest
    people
    she has encountered, acknowledging the impact of his guidance on her professional journey.</p>

<p>Sudarshan, her husband, is recognized for understanding the quirks in her personality and providing steadfast
    support
    through both high and low points. His encouragement has been a significant factor in her achievements.</p>

<p>Margaret, her PhD advisor, holds a special place in her heart. Margaret's influence extends beyond academia, shaping
    Dr. Sruti's personality. She sees a strong resemblance between her character and Margaret's, underscoring the
    profound
    impact of her mentorship.</p>

<p>Lastly, Dr. Sruti expresses gratitude to Professor Mani, a retired professor from IIT Kanpur. He served as her
    mathematics teacher during her school days, instilling in her the importance of attempting to solve problems
    independently, making mistakes, learning from failure, and seeking help only after failing on your own. His
    teachings have left an
    enduring
    mark on her approach to problem-solving and teaching.</p>

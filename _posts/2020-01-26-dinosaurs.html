    Anushka defied societal expectations and transcended boundaries to secure a coveted spot at CSE IIT Kanpur. Her
    narrative
    expands beyond academia, as she takes on the role of Co-head at the STEMinclusive IIT Kanpur Chapter, demonstrating
    leadership and dedication to promoting inclusivity in STEM fields. Anushka's story unfolds as a testament to her
    unwavering resilience, propelling her into a successful position at Microsoft. Her compelling journey serves as an
    inspiration, showcasing her ability to triumph over adversity and make meaningful contributions to both academia and
    the
    tech industry.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">School Days</h2>
<p>In the humble town of Vapi, Gujarat, a remarkable journey began for Anushka Panda, a resilient soul destined for
    greatness despite facing adversity from the very start. Diagnosed with SMA, she couldn't walk from birth, her spine
    forming a challenging C-shape. Undeterred, she embarked on her academic journey, attending a local school where
    accessibility was a constant struggle. Carried to classes by attendants, Anushka's determination shone through as
    she
    excelled in her studies.</p>

<p>At the tender age of 12, life took a turn as she moved to Gurgaon. The new school was wheelchair accessible, but the
    tough academics in the bustling city proved formidable. Yet, against all odds, Anushka not only coped but triumphed,
    emerging as the topper in the 10th standard across India in the DAP category.</p>

<p>With dreams of engineering echoing in her heart, Anushka decided to take on the daunting Joint Entrance Examination
    (JEE) in late 2017. Joining a coaching center, she found herself in a relentless juggling act between regular school
    and
    the demanding coaching classes. These years were some of the toughest in her life, navigating the unfamiliar terrain
    of
    competitive exams and adjusting to the grueling study hours of coaching classes.</p>

<p>The coaching center itself posed a significant hurdle. Wheelchair inaccessible and with cramped classrooms, it seemed
    designed without consideration for someone like Anushka. A defunct elevator added to the challenges she faced daily.
    However, her indomitable spirit refused to be crushed, and she pressed on, determined to overcome every obstacle in
    her
    path.</p>

<p>Then, the world was hit by the global pandemic, and for Anushka, an unexpected silver lining appeared. The shift to
    online learning brought comfort and accessibility. Teachers became more reachable, and the confines of her home
    became
    the perfect study haven. The once insurmountable barriers crumbled as she embraced the virtual classroom, her focus
    unwavering despite the chaos the world was facing.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Journey Through IIT Kanpur</h2>

<p>Anushka Panda's journey through IIT Kanpur was nothing short of extraordinary, marked by resilience, self-discovery,
    and the triumph of passion over adversity. In a time where computer science seemed like the default choice for JEE
    toppers, she found herself grappling with imposter syndrome, constantly questioning whether her pursuit was driven
    by genuine interest or societal expectations. The initial years were challenging as doubts lingered, particularly in
    the shadow of her peers deeply engrossed in competitive programming. It took three years for Anushka to
    unequivocally embrace computer science as her true calling. </p>
<p>Beyond the realm of algorithms and code, Anushka harbored a deep passion for music. A talented singer and former
    piano player, she faced physical challenges as SMA gradually made pressing piano keys a daunting task. Undeterred,
    Anushka took the reins as the coordinator of the Music Club at IITK. However, the music room, located on the first
    floor, posed a significant obstacle for someone using a wheelchair. </p>
<p>Undaunted by the inaccessible environment, Anushka's mother initially played a pivotal role in helping her reach the
    music room. Unfortunately, her mother's health issues emerged midway through Anushka's tenure, restricting her
    ability to accompany her daughter. This unforeseen circumstance led to accusations of "free riding" from her peers.
</p>
<p>Turning adversity into opportunity, Anushka shifted her focus to logistics and social media responsibilities that
    didn't demand frequent visits to the music room. Leveraging her computer science skills, she also worked on writing
    code
    to
    streamline music practice schedules and turn a logistical challenge into an efficient system. </p>
Despite these hurdles, Anushka's determination shone brightly as she organized the Musical Extravaganza, the flagship
event of the Music Club, on her birthday. Attended by over 500 students, the event was a testament to her leadership and
passion for music, transcending the limitations imposed by her condition. </p>
<p>Despite facing the formidable challenges of SMA, she not only found her authentic calling in computer science but
    also left an indelible mark on the vibrant cultural fabric of IIT Kanpur. Her journey is a poignant reminder that
    the human spirit can triumph over adversity, inspiring others to embrace their passions and overcome obstacles in
    the pursuit of their dreams. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Journey at Microsoft</h2>

<p>Anushka Panda's journey as a Data Science intern at Microsoft was marked by a seamless blend
    of professional excellence and inclusive support. Selected for an internship at one of the tech giants, Anushka
    discovered a workplace that went above and beyond to accommodate her needs. </p>
<p>The Microsoft campus, with its commitment to accessibility, stood out as a model of inclusivity. Every corner of the
    campus was wheelchair accessible, showcasing Microsoft's dedication to creating an environment where everyone could
    thrive. What truly set this experience apart was the genuine concern and proactive approach of Anushka's colleagues
    and superiors. </p>
<p>Anushka found herself surrounded by a team that not only valued her contributions as an Data Scientist but also
    actively
    listened to her concerns. Any inaccessible areas were promptly identified and rectified, emphasizing the company's
    commitment to ensuring a barrier-free workplace. Even during team outings, careful consideration was given to
    selecting venues where Anushka felt comfortable navigating, exemplifying Microsoft's dedication to inclusivity
    beyond the office space. </p>
<p>Anushka's remarkable work during her internship spoke volumes about her skills and dedication. Recognizing her
    valuable contributions, Microsoft extended an offer for a full-time position through a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO).
    This was not just a testament to Anushka's technical prowess but also a reflection of Microsoft's commitment to
    fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. </p>
<h2 class="section-heading"> Advice for future generations</h2>

<p>Society may attempt to cast you in predefined roles, but it is essential to break free from these constraints.

<h2 class="section-heading"> A token of Gratitude </h2>
In the tapestry of Anushka Panda's life, she has come to realize that accessibility is not just about physical spaces;
it
encompasses attitudes and perceptions too. Unfortunately, people on wheelchairs often face negative stereotypes that
misjudge their lives and dreams, overlooking the fact that they share the same emotions and aspirations as everyone
else. </p>
<p>Despite these societal challenges, there have been pivotal figures in Anushka's life who have consistently stood by
    her side. Her parents and friends, both during her school and college years, have been unwavering pillars of
    support. In a world that sometimes fails to see beyond the wheelchair, these exceptional individuals have defied
    stereotypes, treating Anushka not as an exception but as a fellow human being with the same rights and dreams. </p>
<p>Occasionally, she has encountered people who view her simply as a fellow human being. These rare souls treat her with
    the kindness and respect they would extend to anyone else. In acknowledging the importance of these relationships,
    Anushka shines a light on the transformative power of genuine understanding and empathy. </p>
<p>Her heartfelt words underscore the significance of those who choose to see beyond physical constraints, recognizing
    the shared humanity that unites us all. These individuals, who treat her with kindness and equality, become the
    bright spots in a world that, at times, struggles to break free from preconceived notions. </p>

        Chatterjee</a> is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at IIT Kanpur. She specializes in Hardware Security
    and is one of the first 3 women
    professors of the Computer Science and Engineering Department of IIT Kanpur. </p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Childhood</h2>

<p>Dr Urbi, hailing from the small industrial town of Kulti in West Bengal, had her roots deeply embedded in a simple
    yet enriching upbringing. Born into a joint family of 8 members, her father served as a dedicated school teacher.
    Growing up, she attended a Bengali medium school where she forged the foundations of her character, with some of her
    most cherished memories woven into the fabric of her educational journey.</p>
<p>The absence of technological advancements in her school, notably the lack of computers, proved to be a pivotal
    catalyst in shaping Dr. Urbi's aspirations. Intrigued by the mysterious world of computers and fueled by a desire to
    comprehend their intricacies, she resolved to pursue a path in computer science.</p>
<p>The absence of specialized coaching centers for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) in her vicinity did not deter
    her spirit. Despite the constraints of residing in a small village with limited resources, Dr. Urbi embarked on a
    self-directed journey to prepare for the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination (WBJEE). Through her determination
    and perseverance, she successfully secured admission into a private university, where she delved into the realm of
    Computer Science.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">College and Career</h2>
<p>Dr. Urbi's academic journey was marked by a steadfast commitment to higher studies rather than conventional
    employment. Following her undergraduate studies, she successfully navigated the challenging Graduate Aptitude Test
    in Engineering (GATE) and secured admission to IIT Dhanbad for her M Tech.</p>
<p>A pivotal turning point in her academic trajectory occurred during her second year at IIT Dhanbad when she achieved a
    remarkable perfect grade of 10 and published her first research paper. This accomplishment served as a catalyst,
    igniting her passion to pursue a Ph.D.</p>
<p>Her exposure to multinational corporations during her tenure at IIT provided her with a global perspective. Preparing
    for their placement tests became a transformative experience, significantly enhancing her skills and knowledge base.
</p>
<p>Undeterred by financial constraints, Dr. Urbi dedicated 1.5 years to diligent work, saving money for her Ph.D.
    However, her family's reservations about her pursuing higher education abroad, particularly as no woman in her
    family had embarked on such a journey, added an extra layer of challenge.</p>
<p>During her M Tech at IIT Dhanbad, she delved into a book on computer security protocols authored by Prof. Debdeep
    Mukhyopadhyay of IIT Kharagpur. Inspired by his work, she aspired to pursue her Ph.D. under his guidance.
    Recognizing IIT Kharagpur's status as one of the premier institutions with top-notch hardware security labs in
    India, she applied and realized her dream of working with Prof. Debdeep as her advisor.</p>
<p>This opportunity became a dream come true for Dr. Urbi, shaping the trajectory of her academic and research pursuits.
    The supportive environment at IIT Kharagpur and the mentorship of Prof. Debdeep were instrumental in her continued
    academic success.</p>
<p>Working with Prof. Debdeep Mukhyopadhyay and Prof. Rajat Subhra Chakraborty had a profound impact on Dr. Urbi's life.
    His lab provided a focused environment, fostering productivity with students dedicating 12-14 hours a day to
    research. Her routine was simple – she only went to the hostel to eat and sleep.</p>
<p>Surrounded by accomplished peers in the lab who regularly published papers and traveled globally for conferences, Dr.
    Urbi initially doubted her place among such intellectual brilliance. However, the supportive environment and her
    encouraging colleagues played a crucial role in dispelling her self-doubt. She emphasizes the importance of being in
    the company of those who are better than you, as it's in such environments that personal growth thrives.</p>
<p>By the third year of her Ph.D. among her brilliant peers, Dr. Urbi's journey took off. She achieved success as
    amazing as her lab mates, winning prestigious prizes in conferences. Her experiences extended beyond the lab; she
    interned in Singapore, participated in various competitions, and also secured victory in a Blockchain competition.
</p>
<p>Dr. Urbi harbored a strong desire to become a faculty member at a leading IIT. Despite receiving a postdoc offer from
    NYU, the plans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting to the situation, she worked online under Prof.
    Debdeep for a few months, dealing with heightened anxiety. Despite tempting offers from private colleges, she turned
    them down, holding onto the belief that better times would come. Taking a leap of faith, she applied to IIT Kanpur
    with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised to be accepted.</p>
<p>IIT Kanpur's work culture brought her immense happiness. Supportive faculty members played a crucial role in her
    adjustment and professional growth. They also assisted her in securing substantial funds to establish her own
    hardware security lab named Secure Embedded and Smart Things Laboratory (SETTLOR).</p>
<p>Her teaching experience at IIT Kanpur was described as amazing, with a continuous commitment to enhancing her
    courses. As one of the students in the first course she taught at IIT Kanpur, I can attest to the positive impact
    she has had on the learning experience. Dr. Urbi's journey underscores the importance of resilience, adaptability,
    and the support of a nurturing community in achieving professional aspirations.</p>

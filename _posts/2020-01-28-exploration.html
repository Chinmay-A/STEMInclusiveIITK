<p>On October 22, 2023, I had the honor of conducting a STEMinclusive RISE session for approximately 150 brilliant minds
    from Government High School, Sidlaghatta, Karnataka in celebration of National Mathematics Day. The experience was truly
    extraordinary.</p>

<p>Throughout the session, I had the privilege of sharing insights into the myriad opportunities awaiting these young
    talents in the world of technology. A particular focus was placed on highlighting the incredible potential for
    women, with an emphasis on exciting paths through esteemed institutions like the IITs and beyond.</p>

<p>What struck me most was the palpable enthusiasm radiating from the students, despite the prevalent stigma against
    girls in STEM within their communities. The determination and curiosity displayed by these 150 bright minds are a
    testament to their resilience and hunger for knowledge.</p>

<p>Navigating a world increasingly shaped by technology, it is crucial to dismantle barriers and encourage more young
    women to explore the expansive possibilities in the field. The session aimed not only to impart knowledge but also
    to kindle a spark of curiosity and ambition within each of the 150 students present.</p>

<p>In cultivating an environment that embraces diversity and inclusion, we are paving the way for a future where every
    individual, irrespective of gender, can make meaningful contributions to the world of STEM. National Mathematics Day
    provided an opportune moment to reaffirm our commitment to this cause. I am optimistic that the seeds of inspiration
    planted today will flourish into a forest of innovation and progress.</p>

<p>Let us collectively strive towards creating a world where opportunities in technology recognize no gender boundaries.
    Together, we can shatter stereotypes and build a future where diversity is celebrated, and the possibilities in the
    world of technology are genuinely boundless.</p>
